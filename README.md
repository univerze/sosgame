# The rules of Bacon

## Rule #1: Show up for events if you registered
We will use the ranking system to maximise activity and player rewards. R3 are active players, R2 neutral, R1 is the danger zone where you may be removed from the alliance. Everyone starts as R2.

If you registered for the event and show up on time you will be upgraded to R3. If you don't show up at all you will be downgraded to R1. If something urgent came up and you can't participate let an R4 know.

## Rule #2: Read the instructions from R4/R5 and join the correct rally/bunker
Influencer trap:
- Set Zoe as march captain (or Eva or Sarge if you don't have Zoe)
- Fill rallies in order, do not only join Rott, be fair to other alliance members

Bunkers:
- Stay tuned

Capital clash:
- When you join a rally always make sure you arrive before the march starts. If you can't use march speedups you will be sent back.

Alliance showdown:
- Set your talents to war
- Use the Massive March skill
- Send your troops to RIGHT or CENTER lane IF your score is above 1800

## Rule #3: Be active and use the alliance chat
We will try and send out frequent updates on plans how to fight the water event or capital clash.
Stay tuned.
