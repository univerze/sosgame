# The rules of Bacon

## Rule # 1
Show up for water event if you registered.
We will use the ranking system to maximise activity and player rewards. R3 are active players, R2 neutral, R1 is the danger zone where you may be removed from the alliance. Everyone starts as R2.
If you registered for the event and show up on time you will be upgraded to R3. If you don't show up at all you will be downgraded to R1. If something urgent came up and you can't participate let an R4 know.
