# The rules of Bacon

## Rule #1: Show up for water event if you registered
We will use the ranking system to maximise activity and player rewards. R3 are active players, R2 neutral, R1 is the danger zone where you may be removed from the alliance. Everyone starts as R2.

If you registered for the event and show up on time you will be upgraded to R3. If you don't show up at all you will be downgraded to R1. If something urgent came up and you can't participate let an R4 know.

## Rule #2: Send the rigth troops
Influencer trap:
- Do not send infantry
- Set Chloe or Eva for march captain
- Fill rallies in order, do not only join Rott, be fair to other alliance members

Capital clash:
- When you join a rally always make sure you arrive before the march starts. If you can't use march speedups you will be sent back.
- When holding capital send the troops 60/20/20 ration (infantry/riders/hunters)

Alliance showdown:
- Set your talents to war
- Use the Massive March skill
- Send your troops to RIGHT or CENTER lane IF your score is above 1800

## Rule #3: Read updates from R4s
We will try and send out frequent updates on plans how to fight the water event or capital clash.
Stay tuned.
